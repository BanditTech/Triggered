# Triggered

In the dynamic world of Path of Exile, where every second counts, we recognized the limitations of AHK for our development needs. While AHK provided useful libraries and an easy-to-use language, it fell short when it came to handling complex operations like parallel data processing, real-time screen analysis, and asynchronous HTML requests that require threading.

Now, picture a realm of limitless possibilities. Our transition from AHK to C# is a leap forward, a chance to embrace a more powerful and versatile language. By embracing C# and leaving behind AHK, we open doors to a world where developers can unleash their creativity and push boundaries at lightning speed, harnessing the full potential of a language designed to accelerate our development process.

With C#, we're harnessing a new level of speed, efficiency, and potential. Multithreading capabilities empower us to execute tasks faster than ever before, leaving limitations and sluggishness behind. C# understands our needs as developers and equips us with the tools to achieve more.

But it doesn't end with speed alone. C# brings stability and reliability to the forefront, ensuring our projects run seamlessly. Memory management becomes effortless, minimizing conflicts and mysterious bugs that used to plague us with AHK. This newfound freedom allows us to focus on what truly matters – creating exceptional experiences for our users.

By transitioning to C#, we're not only embracing a more powerful and efficient language but also opening doors to limitless opportunities. It's time to redefine what's possible. Join us as we embark on this exhilarating journey, bidding farewell to limitations and embracing a world where exceptional experiences are brought to life in record time.
